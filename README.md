## Introduction

This project aims to develop a deep learning model that classifies images using the CIFAR-10 dataset while performing pixel-level image processing. While the model is used for basic image recognition tasks, the pixel processing applications implemented in Assembly help users better understand the images.

## Requirements

The following libraries need to be installed for the project:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- FASM (to compile Assembly code)

## Installation

### Python and Libraries

1. Ensure Python and pip are installed.
2. Open the terminal in the project directory and install the required libraries.

### FASM Installation

1. Download and install FASM.
2. Add FASM to your system PATH so that it can be accessed from the terminal.

## Usage

To get started with your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the appropriate commands to train the model.

### Pixel Processing

In this project, Assembly language is used for pixel processing. The goal is to enhance images through simple brightness adjustment operations.

## Results

The training and testing results can be tracked to evaluate the model's performance. The accuracy of the model is monitored during the training and testing phases.
